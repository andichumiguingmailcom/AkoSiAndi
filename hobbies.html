            </div>
            <p>Besides coding, here are some activities I enjoy in my free time that keep me balanced and inspired.</p>
            
            <div class="hobby-cards">
                <div class="hobby-card">
                    <div class="hobby-icon">🎮</div>
                    <h3 class="hobby-title">Gaming</h3>
                    <p>I enjoy playing strategy and adventure games that challenge my problem-solving skills. My favorite games include The Legend of Zelda series, Civilization, and indie puzzle games that make me think outside the box.</p>

                <div class="hobby-card">
                    <div class="hobby-icon">📚</div>
                    <h3 class="hobby-title">Reading</h3>
                    <p>I'm an avid reader of science fiction, fantasy, and technical books. Some of my favorite authors include Isaac Asimov, Brandon Sanderson, and Neal Stephenson. I try to read at least one book per month to expand my horizons.</p>

                <div class="hobby-card">
                    <div class="hobby-icon">🏃</div>
                    <h3 class="hobby-title">Running</h3>
                    <p>I run regularly to stay fit and clear my mind. I've completed several half-marathons and am currently training for my first full marathon. Running helps me maintain focus and provides a great opportunity to listen to podcasts and audiobooks.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="hobby-card">
                    <div class="hobby-icon">🎵</div>
                    <h3 class="hobby-title">Music</h3>
                    <p>I play guitar and enjoy attending live concerts and music festivals. I'm particularly fond of indie rock and classical music. On weekends, you might find me jamming with friends or practicing new songs to add to my repertoire.</p>

                <div class="hobby-card">
                    <div class="hobby-icon">🍳</div>
                    <h3 class="hobby-title">Cooking</h3>
                    <p>Experimenting with new recipes and cuisines has become a passion of mine. I especially enjoy making Italian and Thai dishes, and I'm currently mastering the art of homemade bread baking. Sharing meals with friends and family brings me joy.</p>

                    <h3 class="hobby-title">Puzzles</h3>
                    <p>I love challenging my mind with puzzles of all types - from jigsaw puzzles to escape rooms. I find that solving puzzles helps me develop better problem-solving skills that I can apply to my work in web development.</p>

                    <h3 class="hobby-title">Gardening</h3>
                    <p>Tending to plants gives me a sense of peace and accomplishment. I maintain a small herb garden and several houseplants. Watching something grow from seed to maturity provides a wonderful counterbalance to the digital nature of my work.</p>

                    <p>Creating digital illustrations and designs has become both a hobby and a complementary skill to my web development work. I enjoy experimenting with different styles and techniques to enhance my creative expression.</p>
